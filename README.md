Custom BlueZ agent developed with Qt and C++

This repository contains the implementation of a custom BlueZ agent in Qt/C++.

A detailed explanation of the code and some background concepts are given in [this](https://mdipirro.github.io/c++/2019/09/27/bluetooth-agent-qt-part2.html) blog post. 

This project depends on Qt5's modules Core and DBus, and uses some features of C++17.
